#-----------------------------------#
#### PREPARING POINT VECTOR DATA AS AN "sp" OBJECT ####

# First, let's load in our data. 
# This dataset is a subset of wolves from a larger study on wolves in Alberta
#   These data are open source, which means they are freely available to download online
#   If you are interested in checking out some cool, open source animal movement datasets,
#   visit movebank.org
# We can start by using "read_csv()" to load our data
alberta_wolves <- read_csv("data/Alberta_Wolf.csv") 

# As always, check out your data before proceeding!
view(alberta_wolves)

# As with the lion dataset from lab 3, we have columns for the name of the individual animal,
#   latlongs, UTMs and UTM zone, UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and local time,
#   and the local timezone

### A NOTE ON "sf" VS "sp" ###
# Both "sp" and "sf" are packages that create spatial layers from vector data (points, lines
#   and polygons)
# In Lab 3, we plotted animal location data in the package "sf". "sf" is awesome because it's
#   very fast and it works really well with the tidyverse (piping) and ggplot. 
# However, "sf" is really new, much newer than "sp". "sp" is the older way of dealing with 
#   spatial vector data in R. That means, some older packages only work with "sp" data, not
#   "sf" data (including the home range package we are using today). But ggplot only works 
#   with "sf" data! So we sometimes need to switch back and forth.
# A vector of animal locations in "sp" will be of class "SpatialPointsDataFrame", whereas the 
#   same vector data in "sf" will be of class "sf" and "tbl_df".
# Unfortunately, we need to work with both sf and sp, as confusing as that is! It's just the 
#   name of the game when using RStudio, where things are always changing and advancing

# We can start by making a copy of our dataset which we will turn into an "sp" object
alberta_wolves_sp <- alberta_wolves

# To make our dataset spatial in "sp", we assign it coordinates and a crs
# Unlike with the package "sf" that we used in Lab 3, in the "sp" package we assign the 
#   coordinates using "coordinates()" and the crs using "proj4string()". 
# Unfortunately, "sp" doesn't work nearly as well with the tidyverse as "sf", so we have
#    to run the functions one at a time instead of writing a pipe
coordinates(alberta_wolves_sp) <- ~ UTMeasting + UTMnorthing

# Remember, for UTMs we need to specify the zone. In our UTMzone column, you can see we are
#   in Zone 12 N (north). North is the default, so we only need to specify zone 12
proj4string(alberta_wolves_sp) <- "+proj=utm +zone=12 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"

# Check the class of your new dataframe
class(alberta_wolves_sp)

# Now our data are in a SpatialPointsDataFrame! 
# I always like to visualize my animal locations before doing any analysis
# To plot these data using ggplot, we can convert them to an "sf" object inside of ggplot by 
#   using st_as_sf() around the data name, and geom_sf() to plot the spatial points
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(alberta_wolves_sp), aes(color = individual))

# Remember our very cool mapview() function? If you want to look closer at the data, 
#   you can color individuals using "zcol" within mapview
mapview(alberta_wolves_sp,zcol = "individual")

# What do you notice about our wolf dataset? How many wolves are there? Do they appear to 
#   be territorial? Do the home ranges appear to be different sizes?

#-----------------------------------#
#### ESTIMATING MINIMUM CONVEX POLYGONS ####

# Now we can start estimating home ranges with the "adehabitatHR" package

# First, make a new tibble called "wolf32253" by filtering alberta_wolves by 
#   individual "wolf_32253"
# Next, make wolf32253 an "sp" object using the coordinates() and proj4strong() functions

wolf32253<- filter(alberta_wolves, individual == "wolf_32253")
class(wolf32253)
wolf32253_sp<- wolf32253
coordinates(wolf32253_sp) <- ~ UTMeasting + UTMnorthing
proj4string(wolf32253_sp) <- "+proj=utm +zone=12 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"
class(wolf32253_sp)

# Let's look at the area of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) home range for wolf 32253.
#   Remember from the home range lecture: an MCP is the smallest polygon with some percentage
#   of the animal locations inside it. Generally, ecologists use a 95% level. That means, 
#   the MCP of the animal is the smallest polygon that still contains 95% of the animal's 
#   locations. MCPs also can't have any inward-facing (concave) angles along the outside - 
#   all lines connecting points around the perimeter have to point out (convex)
# In only one line of code, we can calculate the MCP home range area across a bunch of 
#   different levels, so we can see how the home range size increases as we add more
#   of the animal's data.
# To do this, use function mcp.area()
#   Inside the function, we will call the column of individuals by writing "wolf32253[1]"
#   Then we can specify that the units of our data are in meters (because our spatial data
#     is in UTMs, which is in meters), and that we want home range estimates reported in 
#     square kilometers.
wolf32253_mcp_area <- mcp.area(wolf32253_sp[1], unin = c("m"), unout = c("km2"))

# What do you notice about how home range size increases with level?

# We can derive the outlines of MCP home ranges at different levels using the mcp() function
#   Again, we call the individuals column, and we also specify the percent (or level)
# Researchers usually use th 95% level to determine the home range and a 50% level to 
#   determine the core 
# We'll also calculate the 100% home range to see how it compares
wolf32253_mcp_100 <- mcp(wolf32253_sp[1], percent=100)
wolf32253_mcp_95 <- mcp(wolf32253_sp[1], percent=95)
wolf32253_mcp_50 <- mcp(wolf32253_sp[1], percent=50)

# We can plot the home ranges one at a time...
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_mcp_95), color = "blue", fill = NA)

# Or we can look at them all at once, with the location data as well!
#   I've added a bunch of details to the location data geom_sf() function:
#     cex = how big the points appear, pch = the shape of the points, alpha = transparency
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_mcp_100), fill = "orange", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_mcp_95), fill = "blue") +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_mcp_50), fill = "red") +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_sp),cex = 0.8, pch = 21, col = "black", 
          fill = "yellow", alpha = 0.5)

####** QUESTION 1: ####
#Now that you can see why the 100% level is so much larger than the 95% level,
#     explain why you might  use the 95% level instead of 100% level when calculating home
#     range size
#     Hint: remember the concept of "repeated use" in the definition of a home range

#-----------------------------------#
#### KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATION ####

# MCPs can be totally sufficient for calculating home ranges for some specific animals,
#   but for others, they may overestimate the home range (and size). 
# Look back at our last figure. Especially along the northern portion of wolf 32253's home
#   range, there is a lot of empty space included in the home range that is totally unused
#   by the wolf.
# Kernel density estimators (KDE), which are also called kernel utilization distributions 
#   (KUD) when talking specifically about home ranges, can do a better job of excluding areas
#   that are only very rarely used by the animal.
# Just as with the mcp() function, we can build a KUD with the kernelUD() function.
# There are 2 primary differences:
#   1. We need to specify the bandwidth around each kernel using "h". The default is "href",
#     which lets the computer calculate the bandwidth, aka "smoothing parameter"
#   2. KUDs create a density surface first, before we split it up by levels 
#     (whereas with MCPs we could include the level in the initial function)
wolf32253_kud_href <- kernelUD(wolf32253_sp[1], h = "href")

# We can visualize the density surface we've created using "image()"
#   This plot shows us what is essentially a heat map of the wolf's locations
image(wolf32253_kud_href)

# Now that we have a probability surface, we calculate the area of levels of the KUD
#   home range using kernel.area()
#   Note that the unin and unout arguments are the same as in mcp.area()
# We can't actually calculate a 100% KUD because that would be the entire area of the 
#   density surface, so our levels only go up to 95% this time
wolf32253_kud_area <- kernel.area(wolf32253_kud_href, unin = c("m"), unout = c("km2"))

# Again, we see that the home range size goes up as we include more of the wolf locations.
#   Makes sense! 
plot(wolf32253_kud_area)

# To pull the levels out of our density surface, we use getverticehr() and specity the percent
wolf32253_kud_95_href <- getverticeshr(wolf32253_kud_href, percent = 95) 
wolf32253_kud_50_href  <- getverticeshr(wolf32253_kud_href, percent = 50)

# YOUR TURN!
# Make a plot showing the wolf locations and the 95% and 50% KUDs for wolf 32253
#   Feel free to change the colors or other graphical specifications (cex, pch, alpha) if 
#     you want to improve your visualization!
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_kud_95_href), fill = "orange", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_kud_50_href), fill = "blue") +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_sp),cex = 0.8, pch = 21, col = "black", 
          fill = "yellow", alpha = 0.5)


####** QUESTION 2:#### 
#Let's say we are trying to preserve this wolf's home range, but we only have
#     enough money to protect the core. Which method, MCP or KUD, would you use to guide 
#     this land preservation effort (would you save the land in the 50% MCP core or the
#     50% KUD core)? Explain your reasoning.
# Export the plot to include in your lab report.


#-----------------------------------#
#### COMPARING HOME RANGE SIZE FROM DIFFERENT ESTIMATORS ####

# Now, we'll use the same technique we used to compare lions Romeo and Diana in lab 3 to 
#   compare MCP and KUD home range sizes across levels 
# We can make new columns in each of our area objects so that the home range estimator and 
#   levels are explicit. 
wolf32253_mcp_area$home_range_type <- "MCP"
wolf32253_kud_area$home_range_type <- "KDE"
view(wolf32253_kud_area)

# The area functions don't save the levels as a column, but instead as the names of the rows.
#   Therefore, we need to add the levels by making a new, numeric column from rownames()
# Check out the rownames to see for yourself
rownames(wolf32253_mcp_area)
wolf32253_mcp_area$home_range_level <- as.numeric(rownames(wolf32253_mcp_area))
wolf32253_kud_area$home_range_level <- as.numeric(rownames(wolf32253_kud_area))

# Finally, we combine the objects together using rbind to make them easier to plot together
wolf32253_area <- rbind(wolf32253_mcp_area,wolf32253_kud_area)

# Are MCPs of KUDs usually larger? It depends on how the animal moves.
# Let's plot how the sizes of MCP and KUD home ranges differ across levels using our new object.
#     We can distinguish MCPs from KUDs using color = home_range_type.
#     geom_line() and geom_point() can both be used to show your data points and how they  
#     increase with home_range_level. ylab() can be used to label the y axis "home range size"
ggplot(wolf32253_area,aes(x = home_range_level,y = wolf_32253, color = home_range_type))+
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  ylab("home range size")
  
####** QUESTION 3:#### 
#For this individual wolf, is the MCP or KUD home range generally larger across
#     levels? Which estimator type creates a larger 95% home range?

#-----------------------------------#
#### COMPARING HOME RANGE SIZE FROM DIFFERENT KUD BANDWIDTHS ####

# We used "href" to allow the computer to define our bandwidth when we calculated wolf 32253's
#   KUD above. 
# However, we can also define our own bandwidths (aka smoothing parameters) if we want the 
#   extent of a KUD home range to be tighter (smaller h) or larger (bigger h) around the 
#   animal locations.
# Let's make some new 95% home ranges with some different values for h and see how they compare

# YOUR TURN!
# Use the kernelUD() function to make two new density surfaces, one called wolf32253_kud5000
#   and one called wolf32253_kud1000. For wolf32253_kud5000, set h to 5000 (no quotes). For 
#   wolf32253_kud1000, set h to 1000.

wolf32253_kud5000<- kernelUD(wolf32253_sp[1], h = 5000)
wolf32253_kud1000<- kernelUD(wolf32253_sp[1], h = 1000)

# Now use getverticeshr() to create 95% KUD home ranges for each density surface object. 
#   Name the KUDs wolf32253_kud_95_5000 and wolf32253_kud_95_1000 respectively.

wolf32253_kud_95_5000<- getverticeshr(wolf32253_kud5000, percent = 95)
wolf32253_kud_95_1000<- getverticeshr(wolf32253_kud1000, percent = 95)

# Finally, use ggplot() to plot wolf32253_kud_95_1000, wolf32253_kud_95_href, and
#   wolf32253_kud_95_5000 on the same plot. Also include the wolf32253 location data.
#   Make the home range where h = 1000 the color "green", and the where h = 5000 "white"
# Hint: If you can't see all the home ranges or animal locations, you may need to change the
#   order you listed them in ggplot. ggplot will layer the plots on top of one another, 
#   whereby the first layer is on the bottom and the last is on top.

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_kud_95_5000), fill = "white") +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_kud_95_1000), fill = "green") +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_kud_95_href), fill = "orange", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(wolf32253_sp),cex = 0.8, pch = 21, col = "black", 
          fill = "yellow", alpha = 0.5)

####** QUESTION 4:#### 
#Export the plot for your lab report.


# YOUR TURN - again (already)!
# Reference the method we used to plot comparisons of home range size between our MCP and KUD
# Make a plot that shows how size of home range levels differs for our two new h values
#   (1000 and 5000)
# 1. Start by making home range size objects for both bandwidths using kernel.area()
wolf32253_5000_area <- kernel.area(wolf32253_kud5000, unin = c("m"), unout = c("km2"))
wolf32253_1000_area <- kernel.area(wolf32253_kud1000, unin = c("m"), unout = c("km2"))
view(wolf32253_1000_area)

# 2. Then, make 2 new columns in each of these objects: 1) home_range_level, and 2) bandwidth
#     (this time, we are making a "bandwidth" column instead of "home_range_type")
#     When you make the bandwidth columns, make sure that your values are in quotes ("1000", "5000")
wolf32253_5000_area$bandwidth <- "5000"
wolf32253_1000_area$bandwidth <- "1000"

wolf32253_5000_area$home_range_level <- as.numeric(rownames(wolf32253_5000_area))
wolf32253_1000_area$home_range_level <- as.numeric(rownames(wolf32253_1000_area))


# 3. Use rbind() to make a single dataframe out of your two objects

wolf32253_area2 <- rbind(wolf32253_5000_area,wolf32253_1000_area)
view(wolf32253_area2)

# 4. Make your plot! Use color = bandwidth to distinguish the different bandwidths. 
ggplot(wolf32253_area2,aes(x = home_range_level,y = wolf_32253, color = bandwidth))+
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  ylab("home range size")

####** QUESTION 5:#### 
#Looking at this plot and your plot from QUESTION 4, describe a scenario in 
#     which you might calculate a home range with a large bandwidth rather than a small 
#     bandwidth. In one sentence, explain your reasoning.
# Export your plot for your lab report.

#### ESTIMATING HOME RANGES FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A POPULATION ####

# So far we've been working with data from a single wolf. But all of the methods we have
#   used can be applied to our entire alberta_wolves_sp dataset!

# Let's make 95% MCPs for all wolves...
allwolves_mcp_95 <- mcp(alberta_wolves_sp[1], percent=95)

# ...and 95% KUDs for all wolves (with "href" as our bandwidth)
allwolves_kud <- kernelUD(alberta_wolves_sp[1], h = "href")
allwolves_kud_95 <- getverticeshr(allwolves_kud, percent = 95) 

# Check out your data:
allwolves_mcp_95
allwolves_kud_95

# In these objects, we can see the area of the home ranges for each individual wolf

# We can plot these home range using the same st_as_sf() function we've been using, with
#   adding fill = id to fill in the color of the home ranges by individual
# MCP:
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(allwolves_mcp_95), aes(fill = id))

# KUD:
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(allwolves_kud_95), aes(fill = id))
          
# Combined:
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(allwolves_mcp_95), aes(fill = id), color = "white") +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sf(allwolves_kud_95), aes(fill = id), color = "black", alpha = 0.5)

# We can also compare the area plots across individuals
# MCP:
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
wolves_mcp_area <- mcp.area(alberta_wolves_sp[1], unin = c("m"), unout = c("km2"))
# KUD: 
wolf32253_kud_area <- kernel.area(allwolves_kud, unin = c("m"), unout = c("km2"))
plot(wolf32253_kud_area)

# For our last exercise today, we'll use mapview() to try to learb a little more about
#   our wolf home ranges.
mapview(allwolves_kud_95, zcol = "id")

####** QUESTION 6:#### 
#Which two individuals appear to be in the same wolf pack (they use the
#     same area)?

# Change the basemap (squares on the left under the zoom in (+) and zoom out (-) buttons) 
#   to OpenStreetMap and zoom in until you can see some gray areas with white x's. These
#   are areas of oil and gas extraction.

####** QUESTION 7:#### 
#Which individual overlaps the most oil and gas extraction in their home range?
